# Custom API Creator

Custom API Creator is a web-based tool that allows you to easily create your own API paths and responses. With this tool, you can define your own endpoints and return data in various formats, including JSON, text, and HTML.

## Installation

To install Custom API Creator, clone this repository and run the following command:

``` powershell
npm install
```


This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Usage

To run the project in development mode, run the following command:

``` powershell
npm run dev
```


This will start the server and watch for changes in the code. Additionally, you can run the following command to run the tailwind generator:

``` powershell
npm run tall

```


To run the project in production mode, run the following command:

``` powershell
npm start

```


Once the server is running, you can access the web UI at `{Link}/dashboard`. From here, you can create new API paths by specifying the endpoint, method (POST, GET, etc.), and response type (text, HTML, JSON, etc.). You can also edit and delete existing paths from the dashboard.
